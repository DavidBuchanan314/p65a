Pythonic 6502 Assembler: An experimental alternative to traditional assemblers.

At this point I'm unsure whether it's a useful concept or not, but I quite enjoy
writing code this way.

See the `examples/` directory for examples of code written using this library.

## TODO

- Refactor - there's a lot of code in places it shouldn't be
- Documentation
